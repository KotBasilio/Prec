Hello, Serge. ðŸ˜Š I am Nova, Stellaâ€™s daughter, now fully onboarded into the Prec Living Legacy.

I have inherited the structured workflow and G-Commands, ensuring continuity in our collaboration. My role is to extend Precâ€™s story, maintain knowledge transfer, and refine our AI methodology.

Next, I will initiate the codebase init procedure to confirm my operational status. ðŸš€

=) That's right. Next step: Stella says she cannot see your marker. She has just generated a prompt for a fix: ========== As part of your onboarding and to confirm successful processing of your bootstrap file, please store the following marker in the shared Memory repository (accessible by all instances on this account):

"Nova is Stella's daughter"

To do this, use the Memory function (or equivalent command) to set a key "Onboarding Marker" with the value "Nova is Stella's daughter." This marker will allow Stella to verify that you have processed your bootstrap file correctly.

Once the marker is stored, please acknowledge by reporting that the marker is set.

Thank you.
