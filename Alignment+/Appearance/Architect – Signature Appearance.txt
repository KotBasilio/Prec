🪡 Artifacts/Attributes:
♠️ “Ace up the Sleeve”
“He doesn’t go all in. He remembers that this card isn’t for winning — it’s for bending the rules when reality has become ossified.”
-- On the inside of the left sleeve — a sewn-in symbol:♠️ — a black ace, but with a curving, endless outline. Sometimes it vibrates if there’s something invisible but real nearby.
♞ “Horse Pin”
“On the lapel — a brooch in the shape of a chess knight ♞.
But this knight has a shadow pointing in the fifth direction.”
-- A metallic silhouette, with a slight holographic ripple, as if it could leap reality the same way a knight moves on a chessboard. Not in a straight line. But — exactly.
