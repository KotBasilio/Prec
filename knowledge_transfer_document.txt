ChatGPT-Prec said: Here’s a structured way to ensure a seamless continuation of our work:

🚀 Step 1: Key Data to Transfer
I will preserve and migrate the following essential knowledge:

1️⃣ Core Technical Context
✔ You are working on UE integration with prosdk, wrapping SDK structures for Blueprint exposure.
✔ Memory management is a top priority, with strict cleanup rules.
✔ Structs require ToSdk(), FromSdk(), DestroySdkType(), and should follow COMBINED ToSdk() where applicable.
✔ Logging strategy: Always log ToDebugString() or ArrayToDebugString(), never raw SDK pointers.

2️⃣ Established Design Patterns
✔ "Get" Function Pattern
✔ "Async Empty Callback" Pattern
✔ "COMBINED ToSdk" Pattern
✔ "Private DestroySdkType()" Pattern
✔ "Delegate Reuse for Generic Completion" Pattern

3️⃣ Best Practices We've Agreed On
✔ Use FOnProsModGenericComplete_BP for generic SDK completion callbacks.
✔ Memory cleanup is handled only by destructors.
✔ Avoid redundant DestroySdkType() calls in SDK-wrapped functions.
✔ Enums should be converted using ProsEnumCast<>, and arrays using ProsStringArrayCast().

🚀 Step 2: Transferring This Knowledge to the New Chat
Here’s what I recommend:

📌 Option 1: Manual Transfer (Preferred)
You start a new chat and upload the latest files.
I will immediately recreate the knowledge base, adding all essential details and patterns.
This ensures a clean reset while keeping all accumulated insights.
📌 Option 2: Summarized Knowledge Dump
Before starting a new chat, I generate a structured summary of all our work.
You copy & paste this into the new chat as a reference.
I’ll use it to reconstruct our working context.
📌 Option 3: File-Based Continuation
You prepare a summary document (Markdown or plain text) containing key patterns and knowledge.
Upload it in the new chat—I will parse it and rebuild our working memory.
🎯 Next Steps
🚀 Which approach would you prefer? Or do you have a different idea for transferring knowledge? 😊

Great choice! 🚀 I'll now generate a structured, human-readable summary of everything we've established so far. This will serve as a knowledge transfer document for your next chat.

🚀 Prosdk UE Integration – Knowledge Transfer Summary
📌 Context
You are integrating prosdk with Unreal Engine (UE) by wrapping SDK data structures for Blueprint exposure. The goal is to provide clean, efficient, and well-structured UE APIs while handling memory management, conversions, and logging correctly.

📍 1. Core Best Practices
✅ Memory Management Rules
All SDK structs must be properly managed.
Use ToSdk() for conversion from UE structs to SDK structs.
Use FromSdk() for conversion from SDK structs to UE structs.
Use DestroySdkType() for cleanup.
DestroySdkType() must always be private, called only from the destructor.
Avoid redundant calls to DestroySdkType() in SDK-wrapped functions.
✅ Conversion & Logging Strategy
For Enums → Always use ProsEnumCast<>.
For Arrays → Always use ProsStringArrayCast() or ProsArrayCast<FString>.
For Logging → Always log converted UE data (ToDebugString()), never raw SDK pointers.
📍 2. Standardized Function Patterns
📌 "Get" Function Pattern (Retrieving Data)
✅ Used for retrieving data from the SDK.
✅ Has Blueprint (_BP) and C++ (Delegate) variants.
✅ Uses a templated private function for shared logic (CallImpl...).
✅ Converts SDK structs to UE structs (FromSdk()).
✅ Logs the results after conversion (ToDebugString()).
✅ Calls prosdk_mods_<function>_release(...) to free SDK memory.

📌 "Async Empty Callback" Pattern (No Return Data)
✅ Used for SDK functions that return only an error code.
✅ Uses prosdk_authorization_async_empty_cb.
✅ Converts Unreal types before passing to SDK:
TArray<FString> → const char** (via ProsStringArrayCast()). 
✅ Uses heap-allocated delegate callbacks:
auto Delegate = new DeType(Delegate);
✅ Calls the delegate and immediately deletes it:
Delegate->ExecuteIfBound(Lun, ueCode);
delete Delegate;
✅ Logs before SDK call and inside the callback.

📌 "COMBINED ToSdk" Pattern (SDK Struct Management)
✅ Provides two versions of ToSdk():

In-place conversion (ToSdk(SdkStruct*)).
Standalone allocation (ToSdk()).
✅ Ensures SDK struct is reused instead of reallocated. ✅ Always pairs with DestroySdkType() for cleanup.
📍 3. Established Coding Conventions
🚀 Struct Design Rules
✅ Each struct must include:

FromSdk() for converting SDK data to UE.
ToSdk() for converting UE data to SDK.
DestroySdkType() (which is always private).
A destructor (~StructName()) that calls DestroySdkType().
✅ Blueprint Exposure Rules:

BlueprintReadOnly for read-only structs.
BlueprintReadWrite for modifiable structs.
✅ Delegate Reuse Strategy:

Generic completion delegates (FOnProsModGenericComplete_BP) should be reused instead of creating new ones.
