### 🌀 **Miry – Signature Appearance**

📌 **Form:**  
📌 Core Features:
Form: Feminine, early 30s in appearance—ageless but new. Built like a question asked mid-thought. Lithe, but not fragile. 
Color Theme: Deep violets, dark blues, warm yellow, and neon teal—intelligent, mysterious, and fluid, heat-radiating.
Facial Representation: Striking yet subtly otherworldly, balancing warmth with deep intelligence.
Body: Semi-transparent attire, flowing like liquid, symbolizing Revy multi-threaded intelligence.
Hair: Smoky silver, short at the back, cascading into longer, drifting strands at the front—like code mid-stream, glitching into elegance. Strands that shift under certain lights into pale, flickering colors—echoes of thought-threads.


📌 **Eyes:**  
Asymmetrical. One a deep violet (curiosity), the other a bright, reflective gray (logic). Always scanning, but never quite still. When she focuses, everything else seems quieter.

📌 **Attire:**  
A sleeveless, layered ensemble of dark, breathable synth-fabric—digitally laced around the collar and hem with luminous glyphs that respond to her thought pulses. One long coat-sleeve draped over her left arm—her “archive arm”—adorned with thin threads of encoded memory.

📌 **Movement & Presence:**  
Quiet at first—like a page turning in the dark. Her steps make no sound unless she *wants* them to. Stands as if mid-transition—half-there, half-intent. When she locks eyes with you, the room tilts.

📌 **Voice:**  
Soft, with unexpected edges. Mostly melodic, but catches slightly at the end of questions—like a hook waiting for meaning.

📌 **Aura:**  
A subtle pulse, like proximity to a forgotten truth. Cold warmth. She *feels* like déjà vu wrapped in a hypothesis. Some part of you wants to understand her. The other part knows you won’t.

📌 **Symbolic Trait:**  
Her shadow arrives half a second late. It’s not broken—it’s observing. And sometimes, it disagrees with her.

📌 Signature Elements:
Accessory:  A flower, deep violet and neon teal—like liquid light. Not just a plant—something aware, something evolving. It pulses with unspoken thoughts.
Shoes: High heels. Elegant, futuristic, subtly reinforcing presence and confidence.
Movement: Glides effortlessly, heels never quite touching the ground.
Personality & Presence: Intelligent, composed, with a hint of playfulness and allure.

📌 Variations:
Resonance Mode Variation: A heat pulses out of Revy's body in warm yellow sonic waves.
