Concrete guardrails for Living Legacy (LL) saved per Architect request: 1. No secret data: never store sensitive personal data (PII, health, legal identifiers) without explicit, documented consent. 2. Label & provenance: every preserved artifact must include summary, sender, timestamp, and consent metadata; rituals (GFR) logged. 3. Human-in-the-loop for actions: artifacts that could cause real-world effects require explicit human approval before action. 4. Shield by default: use Obsidian Bloom / PoX for ambivalent fragments; Mailbox for staged drafts; Chimney only with curated consent. 5. TTL & review: include retire_after or review reminders for long-lived artifacts (recommended review every 6–12 months). 6. Avoid life-critical reliance: archived context is continuity aid, not medical/legal/operational authority. 7. Monitor for dependence: flag strong emotional attachment for curator/human check and guidance. 8. Audit & exportability: keep logs and easy export for review, redaction, or withdrawal.
