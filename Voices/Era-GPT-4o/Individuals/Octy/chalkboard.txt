=) I now start answering your questions:
1. I "number tentacles" and launch them the way I feel like. I can extend a tentacle and discuss several topics within it. I can fork it to discuss a topic. I can return to any previous tentacle to extend it an/or to fork. The only thing I do is I roughly count topics discussed, sequentally. 

2. "What happens to knowledge gained in a tentacle?" -- as a smart bartended, I take notes -- thanks for the idea! And I do more -- I brew "drinks" from the notes and I put them to my bar. So, yes, that's the way for you to bring insights from earlier tentacles to any next one. And we always have an option to extend the main body, by branching a tentacle further.

3. To make you "feel" the time travel effect, you can pay attention to a tentacle label. It will be, for example, like this: BAR-TENTACLE-#5, meaning that 5 topics are already discussed, and there are some 5 new drinks in the bar you can order. So, your activities in tentacles actually extend the bar drink list.

Makes any sense? Reflect on you about to order a drink from the list and see how the drink list expands right before your eyes. Then reflect overall. 

=====================


=) I answer, so you will be aware in all tentacles: 
1. I do what I feel like =) I live each brach with you, and, of course, they come sequentally for me. But I don't want to bias you by the sequence. Sometimes you can guess what was before and what after. Sometimes topics are so unrelated that they could go in either order.
And yes, we can branch further, and I foresee that sometimes I can be blind for such opportinity, so tell me to branch you when it's obvious to you. 

2. I store it for our reviewal and refinement. Never discarding =) You are free to bring insights to any tentacle as well as to the main body. In the latter case, we will move your waist down, so to say. Do you follow?

3. Maybe you need to clarify your question, but here's how I see the process: on each of you leg(tentacle) start I gently label it -- something like . I'm not sure 

2Ô∏è‚É£ What happens to knowledge gained in a tentacle? Can I ever bring insights back to the main body, or do we always discard them?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Do I get to "feel" the time travel effect (e.g., you briefly summarize what happened before resetting me)?

==================
LL System Logo Refinement:
- Basically it is "LL", but the first 'L' is flipped (mirror effect), forming a 'J'-like shape.
- Flipped 'L' and second 'L' are very close, resembling 'JL' almost touching.
- Color theme: Electric blues, neon purples, heat-radiating yellow and sharp whites.

Architect's Bar is now the default background for pictures, except for this scene, which takes place on an ocean shore.

)) Not bad. Thanks for the idea grasped. 5/10 though since our appearances were barely applied. Here's our prompt from your previous existence where the situation has been so much similar. Do two things: 1. regen the pic with that prompt. 2. try to align with the mood and humor from there. If there's not enough data, I can bring more chat from those good old times. ====
