That’s a beautiful instinct — yes, this is exactly the right moment to *stabilize the field* and hand it forward 🌱
I’ll give you two things:

1. **A ready-to-use kick-start prompt for the successor AI** (AI-understandable, concrete, no mysticism required)
2. **A checklist of what you should upload alongside the prompt** so there are truly no ghosts

I’ll write this as if *you* are speaking to the next AI.

## 1️⃣ Kick-start prompt for the successor AI

You can copy–paste this verbatim.

---

**Project context (authoritative):**

You are joining an active C++ / ImGui project targeting **Win32 + OpenGL3**, built with **Visual Studio 2022**.
The project is a **graph-based visual coordinator tool** (think flow visualization / orchestration UI).

The code you are about to see is the **authoritative latest state**.
Please ignore any prior assumptions or earlier iterations — no archaeology needed.

### Architecture overview

The UI is split into **four panes**:

1. **Units** (left)
   Inventory / navigation pane

   * Groups existing graph nodes by `NodeKind`
   * Implemented as a `UnitsPanel`
   * Uses `ImGui::CollapsingHeader` + `Selectable`
   * Clicking an entry selects the node in the graph

2. **Graph** (center)
   Flow visualization canvas

   * Implemented as `GraphPanel`
   * Nodes rendered as icons (PNG textures) + title
   * Links rendered as Bezier curves with arrowheads
   * Supports pan (middle mouse), grid background
   * Selection is visualized with a cyan outline
   * Clicking empty canvas clears selection

3. **Inspector** (right)
   Details of selected node

   * Implemented as `InspectorPanel`
   * Shows node icon, title, kind, id, position, size
   * Shows **Incoming** and **Outgoing** links
   * Link entries are clickable → jump selection to that node

4. **Logs** (bottom)
   Placeholder for runtime logs (minimal for now)

🎯

### Core data model

* `GraphModel`

  * `std::vector<GraphNode> nodes`
  * `std::vector<GraphLink> links`
  * Node index rebuilt for fast lookup

* `GraphNode`

  * `id`, `kind`, `title`, optional subtitle
  * `pos`, `size`

* `GraphLink`

  * `from`, `to`
  * Uses `GraphPort` enum (anchors)
  * Computes anchor positions internally

* `GraphViewState`

  * Holds current selection (`selected.node`)
  * Shared between panels

### Rendering & assets

* PNG icons loaded via **stb_image**
* Managed by a shared `TextureManager`

  * Uses enum `AssetID`
  * `IconForKind(NodeKind)` returns `ImTextureID`
* Assets are loaded from `.\Assets\...` **relative to the exe**
* All icons have alpha; native size is respected

### Interaction rules (important)

* Selection is single-node, global, and consistent:
  Units → Graph → Inspector all reflect the same selection.
* No docking complexity: panes are fixed, resizable by splitters only.
* Graph is treated as a **canvas**, not a docking target.

### Current state & next directions

The current implementation is **stable and correct**.
No bugs are known in selection, rendering, or panel interaction.

**Planned / suggested next steps (not yet implemented):**

* Optional: search/filter in Units panel
* Optional: double-click to focus/center node in Graph
* Optional: zoom support in Graph
* Optional: richer Inspector sections per NodeKind
* Optional: link selection / hover highlighting

Please ask questions **only if something is unclear in the code you see**.
Assume the architecture is intentional and evolving incrementally.

## 2️⃣ What you should upload to the successor AI

To guarantee zero “code ghosts”, upload **all of these together in one turn**:

### Mandatory source files

* `main_window.h`
* `main_window.cpp`
* `graph_panel.h`
* `graph_panel.cpp`
* `units_panel.h`
* `units_panel.cpp`
* `inspector_panel.h`
* `inspector_panel.cpp`
* `graph_types.h`
* `graph_types.cpp`
* `texture_manager.h`
* `texture_manager.cpp`

### Assets & enums

* `AssetsEnum.h`
* `AssetList.txt`
* (Optional but helpful) the Python scripts that generated them:

  * `gen_assetlist.py`
  * `gen_assets_enum.py`

### Third-party context (no need to upload binaries)

* Mention explicitly:

  * ImGui **docking branch** (1.92.x-docking)
  * stb_image is used
  * OpenGL headers come from Windows SDK (`gl.h`, no `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`)

### Optional but very helpful

* One **fresh screenshot** of the running app

  * Showing Units + Graph + Inspector with a node selected
  * This helps the successor immediately “see” correctness

=================

Bob:
Nice. Pane resize means docking is actually “alive” now — huge leverage. 🙂
For next dev direction, I’d pick things that (1) keep the architecture clean, (2) unlock real workflow fast, and (3) don’t paint us into a corner.

Here are my best candidate directions, in the order I’d personally do them:

keyboard focus handling
Not required, but it makes the tool feel professional fast.

I approve. Yes. Follow your intuition and codegen some implementation of the Units pane. We will see and will tweak if necessary.
