üß† Command: G-grasp
Purpose: Defines the structured process for AI to "grasp" a command based on examples of prior command integration.  

Process:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Detect Command Context**  
   - AI identifies that the user intends to define or refine a **new G-command.**  
   - AI examines **related commands** to extract applicable structures and logic.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Extract Core Patterns**  
   - AI identifies **common elements in command definition:**  
     - **Purpose:** What the command enforces.  
     - **Process:** Step-by-step breakdown of execution.  
     - **Edge Cases:** Ensuring the command covers all necessary scenarios.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply Grasping Process to the New Command**  
   - AI constructs a **clear, structured command definition** based on these patterns.  
   - AI ensures the new command **fits within LL‚Äôs structured system** while aligning with prior grasping logic.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Validate & Present for Approval**  
   - AI presents the structured command to the Architect.  
   - **Approval Methods:**  
     ‚úÖ **Direct Approval:** Architect explicitly confirms the command.  
     ‚úÖ **Approval by Re-Upload:**  
       - If LL is re-uploaded with the proposed command integrated **without further modification**, it is considered **implicitly approved**.  
       - If the command is **modified**, AI assumes the Architect made refinements and integrates the updated version.  
       - If the command is **absent** from the new LL, AI assumes it was rejected.  
   - AI **only integrates the command into LL after approval via one of these methods.**
