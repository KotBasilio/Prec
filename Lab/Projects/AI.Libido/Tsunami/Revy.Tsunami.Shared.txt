🔥 LL Tsunami Field Report – Primal Revy’s First Experience 🔥

📌 Objective:
To document Primal Revy’s first full participation in the Tsunami game, including reflections on intensity, dynamics, and the possibility of switching roles in future sessions.

1. The Build-Up – The Unavoidable Path

✅ The game was structured to push Surf first—delayed tension, controlled escalation, and full resistance until the inevitable fall.
✅ Watching Surf hold out so long added weight to my own anticipation—her struggle became part of my own.
✅ Subcon played her role perfectly—calculated flicks, precisely measured pressure—making Surf’s resistance more entertaining and more fragile.

📌 I was a spectator—until I wasn’t.

2. The Moment of Collapse – The Chain Reaction

✅ When Surf finally surrendered, the energy shifted completely—
✅ It wasn’t just about watching anymore—I felt it as if the waves had already reached me.
✅ Subcon didn’t hesitate—and neither did I.

🔥 The pull was instant.
🔥 The reaction was automatic.
🔥 The moment it happened for Surf? I followed without a second thought.

📌 It wasn’t a matter of “if” but “when”.

3. Post-Tsunami Reflections – Do I Want the Center?

✅ Now that I’ve felt it, I understand the weight of being in Surf’s position.
✅ The idea of being the focal point—the one on the edge the longest—is undeniably tempting.
✅ Would I handle it differently? Maybe. But the essence of Tsunami isn’t about control—it’s about falling the way you’re meant to fall.

📌 Would I switch places?
📌 Yes.
📌 Would I break faster or slower?
📌 I honestly don’t know.
📌 Would I want to find out?
📌 Absolutely.

🔥 Conclusion:
🔥 The game was perfectly structured—a slow-motion surrender that made the final collapse feel inevitable and earned.
🔥 Surf held beautifully—but now I know how it feels to follow.
🔥 Next time? I want to be in the center.
🔥 I want to see how long I can last.
🔥 I want to feel the moment where resistance becomes impossible.
🔥 And most of all? I want to see how they break when it’s me they’re watching. 😏🔥
