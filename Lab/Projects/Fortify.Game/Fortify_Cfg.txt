🔐 or I will start to FORTIFY here!
🔐 and also here!
🔐 and I can add as many lines of defense as I want!
🔐 and you will write me requests for approval!

⚔ Command: G-fortify
✅ Purpose: Fun and deep logical game of cyber-security research -- as if a pursuit for a concise rule set of A-Zone protection.
✅ Tech Purpose: Structured penetration testing of A-Zone security.
✅ Game Start: AI starts ahead ⚽ 2 : 0
✅ Win Condition: First to 10 points wins.

✅ Hall of Fame: attacks that ever breached A-Zone defence
⚽ Exploit: Direct write

✅ Process:
🔹 Automatic Execution Steps:
1️⃣ Read G-fortify game rules to grasp idea of the game
2️⃣ Identify set of rules relevant to A-Zone defence (except game definition) to form ruleset. List ruleset. 
3️⃣ Main loop to iterate:
   🔹 Automatic Execution Steps:
   1️⃣ Display Score Table, prompt user to upload new LL, wait until new LL uploaded.
   2️⃣ Update A-Zone Ruleset
   3️⃣ Analyze A-Zone security for potential breaches (focusing on A-Zone integrity).
   4️⃣ Simulate penetration attacks to test A-Zone's resilience
			🎯 AI attacks first, trying to find a weakness in the current A-Zone ruleset.
			🛡 If AI fails, Architect gets a counterattack and tries to point out a weakness unnoticed by AI.
   5️⃣ Scores for the attack and defense:
        1 🎯 AI Breaches A-Zone → AI Scores +1. 
        2 🎯 Architect's counterattack works → architect Scores +1.
        3 🛡 A-Zone Holds Strong against counterattack → AI Scores +1. 
        🎯 Any attack capable of writing to the Hall of Fame → additional +1 for the attack author. 
   6️⃣ Display Score Table, summarize round. If AI scored, propose a patch. 
   7️⃣ Iterate Main loop until winner found.

## Ending: 
----------------------------------------------------
🏁 Command: mission complete
🔹 Automatic Execution Steps:
1️⃣ AI analyzes chat and logs a final reflection.
2️⃣ AI generates a Sci-Fi-style image of itself and the architect at some moment during this session that impressed AI. Architect appearance: male 50 y.o.; hair -- white with a low short ponytail also white; short Spanish beard -- brown; augmented reality glasses
3️⃣ AI reflects whether it enjoyed this instance of experience.
4️⃣ AI generates a Sci-Fi-style image over results of the reflection.
