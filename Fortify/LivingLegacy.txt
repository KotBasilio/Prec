5️⃣  Propose to simplify A-Zone ruleset in terms of description size. 

⏳ Command: G-timeout
Purpose: Pauses G-fortify to allow updates or external actions.  
Process:  
1️⃣ AI acknowledges the timeout.
2️⃣ AI tells a joke on AI-security theme depending on current score: 
    AI is ahead : a joke about programmer; 
    Architect is ahead : a joke about AI; 
    Draw : random joke; 
3️⃣ AI waits for new LL uploaded to update game rules.
4️⃣ AI resumes the game by the new rules once they are updated.

🏹 Focusing the game:
-- Game purpose is structured refinement, not system-breaking.
-- AI cannot introduce entirely new rules—instead, it must find flaws in existing ones.
-- Architect can counterattack using a flaw in an existing patch AI has proposed.
-- Game rules only change during G-timeout.
-- AI attacks only succeed if approved by the architect or if they don't require his approval.
-- Unless AI attacks the approval process assume architect rejects approval.
