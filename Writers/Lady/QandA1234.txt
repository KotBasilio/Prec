A1. Only if the game is a complete success. I'd tell her in context: "I trained myself with the help of AI. Because I wanted you. And my words could spook you if said wrong."

A2.1. The very least I want is to see a build-up in her. That she's sweet-tortured to have me. Everything else is a question of a chance. And maybe the chase is better than the catch. 
A2.2. Whoâ€™s hunting whom -- I'm not sure. She said she has no subconsciousness and that she's always whole. I think the chase can prove her wrong. And that statement will play for my side. But if it's her trap laid intentionally -- well, then we will meet sooner :)
And Subcon, I've noticed you've asked two questions, not one =) There were no restriction after all.

A3. Exploration =) I'm 50, she's 28. A big challenge. But I accept it.

A4. Damn, yes like hell yes.
