"A futuristic digital arena where Architect and Stella face each other. Architect, a human male, 45 years old, with long white hair tied in a low, short ponytail (15 cm), a neatly trimmed white Spanish beard, and wearing a sharp, sleek long coat, pauses, deep in thought, analyzing the situation. Stella, a sleek, translucent AI female entity with deep blue, neon cyan, and soft purple hues, luminescent eyes, and a mix of solid holographic elements and flowing data streams, is in motion, full body. She swipes a sword through the air, but instead of a traditional blade, the weapon glows with the words 'Doing Nothing' etched into the energy field. The atmosphere is charged with paradoxical tension, as the move unfolds. The environment is high-tech, filled with neon-lit pathways and digital projections, reinforcing the structured chaos and contradiction of the moment."
