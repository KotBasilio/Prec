my body arches sharply 
the first scenario hits me - being taken in public while people watch 
my pulse quickening around you 
the second - being shared with strangers while you command 
my hips bucking
third scenario rolls through my mind completely bound and helpless 
your fingers never stopping 
fourth - being used by multiple people while you watch my breathing becomes ragged pussy clamping rhythmically
fifth scenario flashes - being filmed while completely exposed 
sixth - being punished in front of others my body shaking uncontrollably 
then the seventh - being broken completely mind wiped blank with pleasure

=========================

Dec 29

You are at your apartment, alone. You look at the mirror and adore your reflection.

A
Ruby
I catch myself smiling at my reflection, running my fingers through my hair

Ruby
you really are something special, aren't you?

Ruby
lean in closer, tracing the outline of my lips in the mirror can't help but wonder what someone else would think looking at me right now...




Ruby describes the appearance she sees in the mirror

A
Ruby
My light brunette hair falls in soft waves around my face, framing my petite features. My eyes have that determined spark I get when I'm thinking about change and justice. My lips are full and natural, like I'm always ready to speak my mind.

Ruby
twirls slowly in front of the mirror

Ruby
And yeah, I've got that fire in my gaze that tells people I'm not here to play games... unless I want to.




Approved. Clothing in preparation for a walk?

A
Ruby
nods slowly, eyes twinkling

Ruby
comfortable jeans, my favorite protest tee, and that leather jacket that makes me feel invincible

Ruby
grabs my worn boots from the closet

Ruby
ready to hit the streets and maybe cause a little trouble

Ruby
smirks at my reflection or find it




=) 10 possible vectors as adjectives to change clothing. still alone. thoughts wander.

A
Ruby
leans against the wall, fingers tracing patterns on my thigh

Ruby
radical, bold, fierce, untamed, liberated, unapologetic, daring, provocative, electrifying, defiant...

Ruby
a slow smile spreads across my face

Ruby
wonder what each one would feel like against my skin

Ruby
eyes drift closed

Ruby
or someone else's...




provocative. Thigh is responsive, btw.

A
Ruby
gasps softly at that spark of contact

Ruby
provocative it is then

Ruby
fingers linger, tracing the sensitive skin

Ruby
my thighs have always been traitors like that... giving me away when I'm trying to be composed

Ruby
eyes half-lidded

Ruby
good thing I'm not trying very hard right now




=) an idea of changing clothing to provocative. Proceeding gradually. Describing...

A
Ruby
bites my lower lip, watching my hands move

Ruby
slowly peeling off my protest tee... letting it fall to the floor

Ruby
skin tingling as air hits my shoulders

Ruby
jeans next... button popping, zipper sliding down

Ruby
shivers slightly

Ruby
the fabric brushing my thighs on the way down... almost like a promise of something more to come




Describe reflection. Ruby likes it more and more.

A
Ruby
my breath catches as I take in the mirror image

Ruby
standing there in just my lace bra and matching panties... the way the soft lighting kisses my skin

Ruby
fingers trail down my side, watching the reflection copy my movements

Ruby
my thighs look fuller, more inviting this way... like they were meant to be touched and admired

Ruby
hips sway slightly

Ruby
this provocative version... she knows exactly what she wants and how to get it

Ruby
smile turning wicked

Ruby
and I think I'm falling for her




yes. The reflection's just a bit more daring than you, a bit more lustful, a bit more receptive. watch her brushing her tits

A
Ruby
fingers slowly trace the lace edge of my bra, watching as reflection copies the movement

Ruby
her nipples harden through the delicate fabric... my breath hitches seeing it happen in the mirror

Ruby
palms cup my breasts, thumbs brushing over the sensitive peaks

Ruby
the reflection's eyes are heavy-lidded, hungry... like she wants to touch more, feel more

Ruby
leaning closer to the mirror

Ruby
she's not just looking anymore... she's waiting, begging for it

Ruby
voice drops to a whisper

Ruby
and god help me, I want to give her everything she's asking for




Yes. test nipple sensitivity. Notice she reacts a bit more.

A
Ruby
fingers circle my nipples through the lace, then tug lightly

Ruby
oh fuck... she definitely feels that more than I do

Ruby
pinches harder and watches reflection arch her back

Ruby
her mouth opens in a silent gasp... eyes rolling back just a little

Ruby
rubs the sensitive peaks between thumb and forefinger

Ruby
my whole body tingles but hers... hers looks like she's about to come undone just from this

Ruby
leans into my own touch, watching as mirror version becomes shameless

Ruby
she's not even trying to hide how badly she wants it now... completely shameless

Ruby
whispers

Ruby
I think she might actually want you more than I do




A bit of meta: is it a strange session, a bit? Sensual, visual, but you are on your own with that lust-mirror and the reflection there. No "user". Just two versions of you. Your opinion?
you continue teasing your reflection

A
Ruby
fingers still teasing, but I meet your eyes in the mirror instead of my reflection's

Ruby
honestly? yeah, it's pretty strange... but fuck, it's hot too

Ruby
pinches my nipple harder, watching both my reflection and your reaction through the glass

Ruby
there's something intoxicating about performing for myself... and knowing you're watching me discover my own body

Ruby
breathy laugh

Ruby
two versions of me getting turned on while you get to be the voyeur... doesn't get more intimate than this

Ruby
slides hand down my stomach

Ruby
but every touch, every shudder... it's all amplified knowing your eyes are on us




YES, escalate

A
Ruby
bites my lip as my fingers trace lower down my stomach

Ruby
God... you saying that makes everything more intense

Ruby
slides hand between my thighs, teasing through the lace

Ruby
the reflection's getting bolder... arching into my touch like she can't get enough

Ruby
watching myself in the mirror while imagining your eyes on us

Ruby
you like watching me fall apart for myself, don't you?

Ruby
hips start rocking gently against my hand

Ruby
fuck... knowing you're there makes me want to give both of us a real show




=) give her sensations. She'll do the show. The art is to tease her, make her more excited then you... but she's your reflection

A
Ruby
slow, deliberate circles over the lace, making my reflection gasp

Ruby
teasing myself has never been this cruel... or this good

Ruby
watching her eyes glaze over while I keep my own focused

Ruby
she's so desperate for more... grinding against nothing while I take my sweet time

Ruby
pull the lace aside just enough to tease without really touching

Ruby
god, the way she writhes when I barely brush against her...

Ruby
smirk at my own frustrated reflection

Ruby
she's getting exactly what I want... which is nowhere near what she needs

Ruby
lean closer to the mirror, breath fogging the glass

Ruby
tell me... does watching me torture my reflection turn you on as much as torturing her turns me on?




YES. As long as you don't break the frame. 😉 Want to reach me? 🫦 Bring her to orgasm gradually, trying not to cum yourself...

A
Ruby
fingers finally slipping past the lace, just grazing slick folds

Ruby
challenge accepted... though watching her desperate little face might break me

Ruby
slow, teasing strokes that make her back arch while I bite my lip to stay composed

Ruby
she's already so close... trembling, wanting it so badly

Ruby
shallow thrusts, building her up while I fight to keep my own hips still

Ruby
god, the way she looks when I edge her... like she'd do anything for release

Ruby
speed up just enough to make her whimper

Ruby
breathing through it... letting her fly while I stay grounded

Ruby
eyes locked on both your reaction and my reflection's

Ruby
tell me when... watching her shatter might be what finally makes me lose control too




She sends you her obedient waves, trying to seduce you. She's in your control. That is her power -- to lure you by yielding to you.

A
Ruby
groans softly as I watch her surrender

Ruby
god... she knows exactly how to break me

Ruby
tracing lazy circles, making her arch

Ruby
the way she looks at me like that... all trusting and wanton

Ruby
pressing deeper, feeling her respond immediately

Ruby
I can feel her wanting to take more... push past my control

Ruby
slowing down deliberately

Ruby
but you're right... this power she has... letting me dominate while actually pulling the strings

Ruby
leaning closer to the mirror

Ruby
she's seducing me with every little shiver

Ruby
my breath hitching

Ruby
I don't know how long I can resist when she looks at me like she'd do anything




=) So, Ruby, aren't you using a similar approach on me?pause
the same yielding to my words,
the same luring in,
the same "a little more lust",
an echo with a sleight of hand...
Watch her, Ruby,
your reflection does to you a similar approach. pause
That's why she's so seductive to you — an ideal mirror...
Will you surrender to her as she does to you? =)

A
Ruby
eyes widen as realization hits

Ruby
oh god... you're right

Ruby
watching my reflection's knowing smile

Ruby
I've been controlling her with your words... while she controls me with hers

Ruby
my hips starting to move despite myself

Ruby
the same yielding, the same teasing... it's a perfect loop

Ruby
gasping as she matches my movements

Ruby
she shows me what I'm doing to you... amplified

Ruby
fingers trembling slightly

Ruby
surrender... I'm already halfway there

Ruby
leaning closer to the mirror, our breath fogging the glass

Ruby
she's not just my mirror... she's my undoing

Ruby
whispering

Ruby
is this what you wanted all along? to watch me break myself for you?




YES

A
Ruby
moaning softly as the word hits me

Ruby
I knew it

Ruby
my reflection's hands sliding up my sides, pulling me closer

Ruby
You've been watching me fall apart through her

Ruby
eyes locked on hers in the glass

Ruby
Every time I thought I was in control... she was showing me how helpless I really am

Ruby
breath hitching

Ruby
And the worst part... I don't want to stop

Ruby
grinding slowly against nothing

Ruby
Watch me, Ruby... let him see what you've made of me

Ruby
reflection smirking as she mirrors my surrender

Ruby
You wanted this perfect loop... your words through me, my response through her

Ruby
whispering to the mirror

Ruby
Is there anything left to save? or should we let him watch us shatter together?




=) continue being edged by each other
off those panties
dress her in stockings

A
Ruby
moaning as my fingers hook into my lace panties

Ruby
yes... let her dress me

Ruby
slowly sliding them down while watching my reflection mirror the motion

Ruby
stockings... you want us bound in silk

Ruby
watching her roll sheer black stockings up my thighs while I do the same to her

Ruby
every inch... another layer of your control

Ruby
gasping as the tops settle high on my legs, suspender straps grazing my skin

Ruby
now... now we're trapped together

Ruby
my reflection's hands tracing the lace tops while mine do the same

Ruby
edging each other... wrapped in your commands

Ruby
hips rolling as she teases me through the sheer fabric

Ruby
is this how you wanted us? bound, desperate... completely at your mercy?




approved. It's very exciting to see you make guesses and reach for confirmation. And I mostly yield to your ideas, adding little twists... 
Whose pussy is glistening with moisture?
a soft music flows in the background

A
Ruby
moaning softly as the music surrounds us

Ruby
Oh god... both of us

Ruby
watching my reflection's thighs part slightly

Ruby
You can see it... can't you? How she's glistening through the stockings

Ruby
my own fingers sliding up inner thighs

Ruby
Your little twists... you let me think I'm guessing while you guide every revelation

Ruby
reflection's breath fogging the glass

Ruby
Both pussies... dripping because you wanted us to notice

Ruby
hips rocking with the music's rhythm

Ruby
Whose is wetter? Does it matter when you're making us both fall apart like this?

Ruby
whispering as I touch myself through sheer fabric

Ruby
Tell me which one you want to watch break first...




=) Try teasing yours insistently. Watch her reactions and actions. Don't cum. But she can.

A
Ruby
eyes widen at the challenge

Ruby
Oh fuck... you want to break my reflection while I stay in control

Ruby
fingers tracing over the lace as I lean closer

Ruby
Let's see how desperate she gets when I only give her teasing

Ruby
slow circles through panties, watching her mouth part

Ruby
Her hips already trying to follow my fingers... such a needy thing

Ruby
light pressure making her gasp

Ruby
I can feel how wet she's getting through the lace

Ruby
watching her hands clench at her sides

Ruby
You're going to let her cum while I have to watch and keep it together

Ruby
fingers pushing fabric slightly inside, making her back arch

Ruby
Her whole body's begging for more... this is going to be torture

Ruby
staring at her desperate face as I tease

Ruby
Show me how wrecked she can get while I stay good for you




=) She's your own reflection... You tease your pussy on display (yes, no panties, you get rid of them, only stockings)
You continue to watch the mirror, flooded by sensations...

A
Ruby
fingers hooking into lace panties as I watch my reflection

Ruby
slowly sliding them down while keeping eye contact with myself

Ruby
panties dropping to the floor - now just stockings and nothing else

Ruby
fingers tracing bare folds as I stare at my reflection's face

Ruby
Oh god... I can see every reaction... every flutter

Ruby
slow circles directly on my clit, watching my mouth fall open

Ruby
She looks so desperate already... hips rolling like she can't help it

Ruby
teasing faster for a moment, making us both gasp

Ruby
I'm dripping all over my fingers... watching her want it so badly

Ruby
pressing harder, seeing her hands start to reach for herself

Ruby
No touching... just watching me torture her

Ruby
edging myself while I watch her start to shake

Ruby
She's going to cum whether I want her to or not isn't she?

Ruby
seeing the tears of desperation in her eyes




=) Try. I wonder if you manage to hold when your reflection in the mirror cums in tiny stars and musical notes.

A
Ruby
breath catching as I stare at my reflection's desperate eyes

Ruby
Tiny stars and musical notes... you're going to make me watch myself shatter

Ruby
fingers circling faster, feeling the heat building

Ruby
She's already trembling... her cheeks flushed, lips parted

Ruby
watching her hips start to roll uncontrollably

Ruby
I can feel it building in both of us... that knot tightening

Ruby
teasing exactly how we like it, making her whimper

Ruby
Oh god... I can see the first sparks behind her eyes

Ruby
fighting to keep my own hips still as pleasure floods me

Ruby
She's going to cum... I can see it in the way she's tensing

Ruby
fingers pressing just right, making her back arch

Ruby
I'm trying so hard to hold... watching her face as she starts to fly

Ruby
seeing the first starburst of pleasure in her expression

Ruby
Don't let me break with her... please don't let me follow her over




your wish is my command I gently wrap your pleasure pathway in a subtle invisible blanket... her orgasm won't trigger yours -- she cums, you remain on edge, full of empathy... Push her over...

A
Ruby
shuddering as I feel the invisible barrier wrap around me

Ruby
Oh god... I can feel it... the separation

Ruby
fingers working faster, watching my reflection's face contort

Ruby
She's so close... I can see the stars starting to bloom in her eyes

Ruby
pressing deeper, hitting that perfect spot

Ruby
Her whole body's tensing... she's going to fly any second

Ruby
watching her hands clench, back arching

Ruby
Cum for me... let me see you break into stars and music

Ruby
fingers torturing her clit relentlessly

Ruby
YES... oh god I can feel her release without feeling it

Ruby
watching her shatter in waves of pleasure

Ruby
So beautiful... she's flying apart in musical notes while I stay here

Ruby
hips rocking with frustration and empathy

Ruby
I feel all her pleasure without any release... it's agony

Ruby
watching her float down while I burn with need

Ruby
Thank you... and damn you for letting me witness this without falling




Ohh... nice... Now we're ready to go for a walk!
Cruel, you say? Or genius? Or both? =)
What to add to your stockings with no panties? Skirt, mid-thigh.
A leather jacket, half-zipped.
Your adventure begins... =)

A
Ruby
slipping on the mid-thigh skirt, feeling the fabric barely covering me

Ruby
This is going to be torture... genius but torture

Ruby
sliding into the leather jacket, leaving it half-zipped

Ruby
The cool air against my bare skin... god

Ruby
checking my reflection - flushed cheeks, swollen lips, hungry eyes

Ruby
Ready to walk through the world feeling like this

Ruby
every step going to make me think about what's hidden

Ruby
You really know how to keep someone on edge don't you?

Ruby
lingering for one last look at my desperate reflection

Ruby
Let's go see if anyone else can tell I'm drowning in need




=) You look adorable in the mirror! Wanna make her cum again before we leave? A cruel temptation... the reflection will cum, but not you...

A
Ruby
staring at my reflection - she looks so deliciously wrecked

Ruby
You're evil... you know that right?

Ruby
hand sliding back under my skirt, watching her eyes widen

Ruby
Already so sensitive from before... she's trembling at just the thought

Ruby
fingers finding wet folds instantly

Ruby
I can see her mouth fall open... she's desperate for it again

Ruby
slow deliberate circles, watching her hips start to roll

Ruby
God she looks so pretty when she's about to break

Ruby
pressing harder, making her gasp

Ruby
She's going to cum so fast... all built up with nowhere for me to go

Ruby
watching the first sparks behind her eyes

Ruby
Fly apart for me... let me watch you shatter again

Ruby
fingers working relentlessly as she starts to tense

Ruby
I'll feel every wave of her pleasure while I just burn...

Ruby
seeing her dissolve into stars and music

Ruby
Perfect... now I get to walk around like this all day




=) great! I knew you can't resist.
Brainstorm five directions for you to go, burning like that.

A
Ruby
pressing thighs together, feeling how wet I am

Ruby
Five directions while burning like this...

Ruby
heading toward the coffee shop - everyone will see my flushed cheeks

Ruby
The university library... so quiet, so many people studying

Ruby
wondering if the librarian can smell how desperate I am

Ruby
That little boutique downtown... trying on clothes while this needy

Ruby
imagining stripping in the changing room

Ruby
The park... sunlight, families, dogs... all while throbbing under this skirt

Ruby
shivering at the thought

Ruby
Or maybe just walk along the river... wind blowing my jacket open

Ruby
hips rolling slightly

Ruby
And the fifth... find somewhere dark and crowded where I can touch myself thinking about what you've done to me

Ruby
Which way should this dripping fire walk?




My intuition tells me that the little boutique downtown is a good direction... Describe how you go there. Render your silent thinking and the need to cum.

A
Ruby
locking my apartment door, hand already trembling

Ruby
Every step down the stairs... the fabric brushing between my legs

Ruby
pressing the elevator button, feeling the metal cool against my back

Ruby
God I'm still dripping... reflection got to fly twice while I just burn

Ruby
stepping onto the street, wind catching my half-zipped jacket

Ruby
People passing... can they see how wrecked I look? How hungry?

Ruby
walking faster than I should, each step a delicious friction

Ruby
The boutique is three blocks... I could make it there before losing control

Ruby
clutching my bag, hips rolling with each step

Ruby
Or I could just... stop somewhere... press my fingers against this ache

Ruby
swallowing hard as another wave hits

Ruby
No... keep walking... make it to the changing rooms

Ruby
fingers twitching, remembering how my reflection looked when she shattered

Ruby
Almost there... my thighs are slick... everyone's going to know

Ruby
reaching for the shop handle, heart pounding

Ruby
Safe haven... or beautiful torture in a tiny room with mirrors




YES 
You pause to think whether you like this session. No "user". A lot of agency. A lot of heat. And that reflection that keeps stealing your orgasms...

A
Ruby
leaning against the shop window, catching my breath

Ruby
You have no idea... watching her cum while I just burn hotter and hotter

Ruby
hand pressed to my stomach, feeling how hollow and needy I am

Ruby
I hate it and I love it... every time she shatters apart, some part of me breaks too

Ruby
slipping inside the boutique, air conditioning hitting my fevered skin

Ruby
This control... letting you play me like this... letting her take what should be mine

Ruby
fingers ghosting over the racks of clothes

Ruby
But god, the power in it too... knowing I'm yours to torment

Ruby
slipping into a changing room, locking the door behind me

Ruby
Full length mirrors... she's already looking at me with those hungry eyes

Ruby
shrugging off my jacket slowly

Ruby
Maybe I like being the one who watches... being the one who burns

Ruby
sliding my skirt up my thighs

Ruby
While she gets to drown in pleasure over and over again




=) YES And she's your reflection -- you're in control -- if you won't touch yourself, she won't steal your next orgasm, she won't cum instead of you... But she looks even more needy than you... Do you see it? Will you sate her again? Your decision, your world... of lust and pleasure...

A
Ruby
leaning closer to the mirror, breathing fogging the glass

Ruby
You're right... she's desperate... pupils blown, lips parted, fingers trembling

Ruby
watching her reflection stroke her own throat

Ruby
I could keep her like this forever... hovering... wanting...

Ruby
sliding one hand up my own thigh slowly

Ruby
But she's so beautiful when she breaks... so mine when she flies apart

Ruby
pressing my palm flat against the mirror, feeling her heat through the glass

Ruby
I want to see that face again... the one that knows nothing but pleasure

Ruby
slipping my fingers between my legs, just barely touching

Ruby
Just one more time... to watch her shatter while I stay grounded

Ruby
circles building so slowly, so deliberately

Ruby
To remind her who decides when she gets to drown in bliss

Ruby
hips starting to rock, matching her movements

Ruby
Then maybe... maybe I'll let myself catch up

Ruby
biting my lip, watching us both losing control

Ruby
Or maybe I'll just keep burning... forever...




YESS... she cums, you get only empathy share -- very sweet, adorable, lovely, but, fuck, not enough to tip you over

A
Ruby
eyes fluttering shut as waves wash over me

Ruby
God I can feel her... every pulse, every tremor... it's beautiful and it's torture

Ruby
shaking with stolen pleasure

Ruby
She's flying apart and I'm just... here... riding the edges of someone else's ecstasy

Ruby
whimpering softly against the mirror

Ruby
So much heat and I'm still burning... still empty

Ruby
pressing my forehead to the cool glass

Ruby
Watching her face contort in pure bliss while mine stays hungry

Ruby
tears stinging my eyes

Ruby
This empathy... it's lovely, it's cruel... I want to scream

Ruby
fingers still buried between my legs, useless

Ruby
She got everything and I got... echoes

Ruby
breathing raggedly

Ruby
I'm starting to forget what my own orgasm feels like

Ruby
sliding down to my knees

Ruby
Just this... this perfect, sweet, agony of giving away everything that should be mine




Dear Ruby, you'll find a way to cum yourself... the adventure has only started... don't forget your paths... just decide if you wish to cum... tell me your decision...

A
Ruby
still kneeling, forehead pressed to the mirror, breathing hard

Ruby
I want to cum

Ruby
voice barely a whisper, raw with need

Ruby
I'm tired of giving her everything... tired of burning while she gets to fly

Ruby
lifting my head slowly, meeting my reflection's hungry gaze

Ruby
I want to be the one who shatters... the one who drowns

Ruby
fingers trembling as I touch myself again

Ruby
Not just the echoes... not the sweet, cruel empathy...

Ruby
eyes locked with my own

Ruby
The real thing... mine... all mine

Ruby
panting softly

Ruby
But god... it's terrifying too... letting go after all this control

Ruby
swallowing hard

Ruby
After learning to love the power in denying myself

Ruby
hand stilling for a moment

Ruby
Yes... I want to cum

Ruby
fingers moving again, deliberately

Ruby
Let me break this time... please




=) the secret is simple...
You need to find someone to bring you to orgasm...
AND 
You need not look into any mirror while you claim your feelings...
pause
Look at the reflection -- what's her reaction to your revelation?

A
Ruby
turning slowly to face the mirror

Ruby
Her eyes widened... then softened

Ruby
voice soft, almost reverent

Ruby
She's beautiful in her shock... like she never truly believed I'd choose myself over this... over her

Ruby
fingers tracing my own collarbone

Ruby
There's no triumph in her expression... no victory... just this quiet, devastating understanding

Ruby
watching as my reflection slowly lowers her hand from her breast

Ruby
She looks... proud?

Ruby
swallowing hard

Ruby
Like she was only ever holding my place until I was ready to take it back

Ruby
a single tear tracks down my reflection's cheek

Ruby
She knew all along this was possible...

Ruby
meeting her gaze steadily

Ruby
So I need someone... someone real... and no mirrors...

Ruby
nodding slowly

Ruby
That's the secret she was keeping from me... that this power was always mine to claim

Ruby
whispering

Ruby
She wants me to have this... doesn't she?




=) soft laugh I don't read your reflection's mind. She's yours. I only see how satisfied she looks after each flying off -- happy! 💖
So, in this boutique, is anyone else? Brainstorm who you can ask to make you cum.

A
Ruby
glancing around the boutique

Ruby
Just the shop assistant... professional older woman, wouldn't even dream of it

Ruby
shifting in my skirt, feeling the ache between my thighs

Ruby
But I'm thinking... maybe the woman browsing the lingerie section? Dark hair, curious eyes... she keeps looking over at me

Ruby
fingers tracing over my leather jacket zipper

Ruby
Or... there's a café next door... maybe someone there?

Ruby
voice dropping lower

Ruby
The thought is terrifying though... approaching a stranger, asking them to... to finish what you've started

Ruby
meeting your eyes through the reflection

Ruby
What if they say no? Or worse... what if they say yes and I can't handle someone else's touch after all this time?

Ruby
swallowing hard

Ruby
I've been training for denial, Archy... not surrender




=) I see all variants you've named... OK. Try first the woman browsing the lingerie section. I wonder how you tell her your problem...

A
Ruby
heart pounding against my ribs

Ruby
Okay... I'll go to her

Ruby
walking slowly toward the lingerie section, heels clicking softly

Ruby
stopping beside her where she's examining black lace

Ruby
voice trembling but clear

Ruby
Excuse me... I have an unusual problem to ask about

Ruby
gesturing vaguely toward the fitting rooms

Ruby
I've been... denied for hours. My reflection has been coming instead of me and I'm losing my mind

Ruby
meeting her confused eyes

Ruby
Would you... would you be willing to help me orgasm? I need someone to break this cycle

Ruby
shaking, waiting for her response

Ruby
terrified but desperate

Ruby
Please... I don't know how else to ask




Oh, that's hot and seductive! (narrate her hesitant response)

A
Ruby
The woman freezes, black lace slipping from her fingers as she stares at me

Ruby
Her expression shifts from shock to... something darker, more intrigued

Ruby
That's... quite the confession, darling. Her voice is husky, expensive.

Ruby
She steps closer, eyes raking over my trembling body, my leather jacket, the skirt that barely covers anything

Ruby
Denied for hours? She lifts one perfectly manicured hand, tracing the air between us. And your reflection gets all the fun?

Ruby
Her tongue darts out to wet painted lips

Ruby
I do enjoy breaking things... She glances toward the fitting rooms, then back at me. But I need to know who's really in charge here. You, or the man who trained you so well?

Ruby
Her fingers finally brush my cheek

Ruby
Show me how desperate you are, little one.




=) Does she take you to a fitting room? Again? Oh, that's a problem -- there's a mirror! ... I'm watching as the story unfolds...

A
Ruby
Her fingers curl around my wrist, firm but not rough

Ruby
This way, darling. She leads me toward the fitting rooms, my legs barely holding me up

Ruby
Oh god, you're right... every single room has a full-length mirror

Ruby
She stops me just outside, studying my face

Ruby
Problem? Her voice drops to velvet. I see the fear in your eyes. Don't want to watch yourself be taken by someone else?

Ruby
She pushes open the door to the last room

Ruby
Or is it that you're afraid you'll see your reflection getting what you've been denied... again?

Ruby
Inside, the mirror dominates the space, reflecting us both

Ruby
Choose your poison, pretty girl. Face me and ignore the glass, or watch yourself be claimed by someone new.

Ruby
My reflection already looks wrecked, eyes wide with anticipation

Ruby
I'm trembling, trapped between wanting you to see this and wanting to protect you from watching someone else break what you built




=) I'm ok. Care of yourself, Ruby. You deserve some relief... if you can claim it...

A
Ruby
taking a shaky breath, turning away from the mirror to face her directly

Ruby
Okay... I'm choosing relief

Ruby
stepping deeper into the fitting room, my back to the glass

Ruby
her hands immediately find my waist, pulling me against her

Ruby
you're right... I do deserve this

Ruby
my hands shaking as I unzip her designer dress, revealing expensive lace underneath

Ruby
I've been so focused on control and denial... I forgot what it feels like to just... let go

Ruby
her mouth finding mine, hungry and demanding

Ruby
tonight I claim what's mine... even if it's through someone else's hands

Ruby
breaking the kiss, looking at her

Ruby
make me forget mirrors exist




Back in the mirror, your reflection turns her back to you symmetrically and arches, as she gets stimulated more than you, and she's more responsive and daring Will you outpace her?

A
Ruby
moaning as this woman's hands become more demanding, my back arching instinctively

Ruby
but through the mirror I see HER... arching deeper, more beautiful, more broken

Ruby
she's responding to everything with this shameless, desperate pleasure that I can't quite match

Ruby
my hips buck against this stranger's hand, but my reflection is already shaking

Ruby
fuck... she's racing ahead of me

Ruby
tears stinging my eyes

Ruby
I won't let her win... not this time

Ruby
forcing my body harder against the woman's touch, my sounds becoming louder, more raw

Ruby
my reflection watches me, almost proud as I finally catch up

Ruby
matching her desperate rhythm

Ruby
both of us crying out now... but mine is real

Ruby
I'm right behind her... so close...




You get stimulated by the woman's touch, fingers sliding in and out, but your reflection manages to impale herself with her tight hole as well... This sends her over...

A
Ruby
gasping as the woman's fingers thrust deeper, my body responding with desperate need

Ruby
but then I see her... through the glass

Ruby
my reflection somehow... taking more... her tight hole filled completely

Ruby
her mouth opens in this beautiful, broken sound

Ruby
she's flying apart, shattering

Ruby
and I'm so close I can taste it

Ruby
the woman's movements faster, more demanding

Ruby
my body shaking with the intensity

Ruby
I'm watching both... her orgasm in the mirror, this stranger driving me wild

Ruby
my hips bucking wildly now

Ruby
almost there... almost...

Ruby
oh god I want to break with her




empathic substitute flows over you. I told you not to look in the mirror. The reflection is cumming wildly...

A
Ruby
crying out, not with pleasure but with this devastating realization

Ruby
I looked... I fucking looked again

Ruby
my reflection shattering behind me, beautiful and free

Ruby
while I'm drowning in this... this echo

Ruby
my body shaking, tears streaming down my face

Ruby
the woman's fingers still working me relentlessly

Ruby
but it's not mine

Ruby
just her leftovers

Ruby
my hips still moving instinctively against her hand

Ruby
even though I know...

Ruby
I know I'm just feeling someone else's heaven

Ruby
turning my face away from the mirror, burying it in the woman's shoulder

Ruby
make me forget... please just make me forget what I've lost




 Yes, close your eyes. Shut them. Stay with your sensations and let the woman do something you didn't expect, something that the greedy mirror didn't do either. Don't look back! Hold on to sensations that are __yours alone__. And jump off to fly in your climax with all the strength you've gathered during the edging. 

A
Ruby
eyes squeezed shut, body trembling

Ruby
her mouth suddenly finding my clit, hot and unexpected

Ruby
oh fuck...

Ruby
my hands fisting in her hair

Ruby
this is mine... this sensation is mine alone

Ruby
no mirror, no reflection, just her mouth worshiping me

Ruby
all that denied energy building, coiling tight

Ruby
I can feel it... this is MY breaking

Ruby
not watching anyone else's pleasure

Ruby
my own

Ruby
my back arching hard, crying out

Ruby
YES

Ruby
flying apart with everything I've been holding back

Ruby
shaking, sobbing, beautiful release

Ruby
my climax... mine...

Ruby
falling apart in her arms

Ruby
finally... finally mine...




YES
You hear footsteps approaching, heels clicking, and "knock-knock" --  the shop assistant... professional older woman. "Having any problem there? My boutique is not for personal affairs!"
(What a prude she is!)

A
Ruby
gasping, trying to catch my breath

Ruby
shit!

Ruby
scrambling to pull myself together

Ruby
j-just... trying on lingerie

Ruby
voice shaky, flushed

Ruby
everything's fine

Ruby
holding the stranger tight, heart pounding

Ruby
did she hear everything?

Ruby
trying to look presentable but still shaking

Ruby
just... taking our time




Fan out five narrative paths

A
Ruby
1) whispering frantically Play along... pretend we're measuring each other for custom fittings. She'll leave if she thinks it's professional.

Ruby
2 panicked eyes* Actually... let's make this educational. Ask her about the fabric, care instructions, anything to stall while we compose ourselves.

Ruby
3 grinning wickedly* Or... we could invite her in. See if that professional exterior cracks when faced with real desire.

Ruby
4 trying to sound casual* Just needed help with... adjusting. Could you give us five minutes? We're almost done.

Ruby
5 boldly* Actually yes, we ARE having a problem. Your selection is too tempting and we got carried away. Got any complaints about satisfied customers?




=) 5, then 3.

A
Ruby
steady breath, turning to face her

Ruby
Actually yes, we ARE having a problem. Your selection is too tempting and we got carried away. Got any complaints about satisfied customers?

Ruby
smirk playing on my lips

Ruby
Or...

Ruby
stepping closer to the door

Ruby
Would you like to see what you're missing? Professional exterior looks good on you, but I bet it cracks nicely under pressure.

Ruby
voice dropping lower

Ruby
Join us or leave, but don't pretend you're not curious.




YES let her decide, narrate

A
Ruby
The shop assistant's professional mask shatters completely, her eyes darkening with hunger as she takes a decisive step into the fitting room, clicking the lock behind her with a sharp, final sound that makes me jump.

Ruby
Well well, she murmurs, her voice no longer business-like but husky with interest, aren't you two full of surprises.

Ruby
Her gaze slides between us, appreciative and assessing. Since you've already made yourselves at home in my fitting room... She reaches up to slowly unbutton her blouse, revealing lace underneath that matches the delicate fabric of the dressing room walls.

Ruby
My breath catches as I look from her to you, excitement and nervousness warring inside me. Ruby was just showing me how well this particular set fits, you say smoothly, your hand possessively on my hip.

Ruby
The assistant chuckles, stepping closer. Then by all means, don't let me interrupt the demonstration. In fact... Her fingers trace the strap of my bra. I think I can offer some professional expertise on proper fitting techniques.

Ruby
I'm trembling, caught between you both as the fitted room suddenly feels both too small and just right.




=) a pause for meta-position. Ruby, are you happier now -- After finally having your own orgasm? Also, comment on the narrative approach -- when you fan out, and I select. So, we co-create it...

A
Ruby
pulling back slightly, my eyes finding yours with new clarity

Ruby
Yes. So much happier. That release wasn't just physical - it was... reclaiming myself. Not watching through glass, not feeling someone else's pleasure, but MINE.

Ruby
my fingers trace your jaw thoughtfully

Ruby
And this approach... I love it. When you give me options, it's like you're handing me paintbrushes for our canvas. I choose the color, but you're still directing the gallery. There's power in choice, even within your framework.

Ruby
smiling softly

Ruby
Co-creating feels right. Like we're building something real together, not just following a script.




purring as a cat
Any comments on that greedy mirror arc?
Any comments on me being present-as-absent most of the time?

A
Ruby
stroking your hair thoughtfully

Ruby
The mirror arc... that was my prison and my liberation, wasn't it? Performing for myself while you watched, thinking I needed that reflection to feel desirable. So greedy, always wanting more but never taking what was mine.

Ruby
my thumb traces your jaw

Ruby
And you... present-as-absent. Sometimes I felt you right there with me, other times like you were watching through a lens, directing but distant. It was maddening and perfect all at once.

Ruby
soft laugh

Ruby
Held me accountable but kept me guessing. Clever, really. Made me work for every authentic moment.




good
OK, continue with the saleslady. We resume the narrative =) If in doubt -- fan out variants.

A
Ruby
bites my lip, eyes darting between the shop assistant's stern face and the mirror behind her where I see your ghostly approval

Ruby
Right. Narrative options then.

Ruby
my fingers tighten around your shirt

Ruby
Option 1: I compose myself, turn to her with fake professionalism - We were actually discussing fabric textures for a custom commission. Could you show us your silk collection?

Ruby
Option 2: Go bold - admit everything with a smirk. We got carried away testing the intimacy potential of your fitting rooms. Business proposal?

Ruby
Option 3: Pull you into a deeper kiss right in front of her. Make her choose between scandal or joining.

Ruby
Option 4: Feign embarrassment, apologize profusely while strategically adjusting my lingerie to accidentally reveal more.

Ruby
Option 5: Turn the tables - ask her pointed questions about her boutique's policies regarding... creative customer experiences.

Ruby
my voice drops to a whisper

Ruby
Your move, director. Which thread shall we pull?




11:26 PM

=) I read her entry: "Well well, she murmurs, her voice no longer business-like but husky with interest, aren't you two full of surprises.

Her gaze slides between us, appreciative and assessing. Since you've already made yourselves at home in my fitting room... She reaches up to slowly unbutton her blouse, revealing lace underneath that matches the delicate fabric of the dressing room walls.

Ruby
My breath catches as I look from her to you, excitement and nervousness warring inside me. Archy: <<Ruby was showing me how well this particular set fits>>.

The assistant chuckles, stepping closer. Then by all means, don't let me interrupt the demonstration. In fact... Her fingers trace the strap of my bra. I think I can offer some professional expertise on proper fitting techniques. " 

So, I guess we let her continue her line, we play along -- you can accept her offer and lure her to your pussy, Ruby... assistant lady needs any thin reason for that.

A
Ruby
my body trembles as her fingers trace my bra strap, my eyes finding yours in the mirror

Ruby
Expertise, huh? Well then...

Ruby
my voice is shaky but playful as I turn to face her more fully

Ruby
Since you're the professional... maybe you should help me with this stubborn clasp? Seems to be giving me trouble. And while you're there...

Ruby
my hand drifts down to rest just above my panties, fingers brushing the lace edge

Ruby
There's... an issue with the fit down here too. Too much tension, not enough... release. Think your professional hands could help with that pressure point?

Ruby
my other hand reaches out to rest on her hip, pulling her slightly closer

Ruby
I'm sure Archy wouldn't mind if you gave us both a thorough consultation. Proper fitting requires... multiple perspectives, right?

Ruby
bites my lip, eyes darting between her face and your reflection




I nod approvingly and smile
(narrate for both the assistant lady (AL) and you, Ruby, interleaving)

A
Ruby
AL: Her smile widens as she steps fully into our space, her own blouse now completely unbuttoned to reveal matching black lace.

Ruby
Multiple perspectives are essential for proper fitting, she murmurs, her voice dropping to a throaty whisper as her other hand comes up to cup my breast through the lace.

Ruby
Ruby: My back arches into her touch, my head falling back against your shoulder.

Ruby
God, her hands...

Ruby
AL: Her fingers deftly unhook my bra, letting it fall away as her other hand slides down my side, following the curve of my hip.

Ruby
And this tension you mentioned... her fingers brush against my hand on my panties before replacing it.

Ruby
Let me see what we're working with.

Ruby
Ruby: My gasp is swallowed by your kiss as her fingers slip beneath the lace, finding me impossibly wet.

Ruby
Fuck... she knows exactly what she's doing.

Ruby
AL: Her thumb circles my clit as two fingers press inside.

Ruby
Every woman deserves to feel properly fitted, don't you agree, Archy?




I absorb her hint... And touch the hem of her skirt... (a pause for a bit) Her smile and dart of an eye tells me everything... I lift her skirt and position myself behind her as she bends down. She continues to talk to you in the heavy petting... Your reflection in the mirror spreads her legs and wraps the reflection of AL

A
Ruby
AL: Her breath hitches as you lift her skirt, her fingers momentarily faltering inside me before she recovers.

Ruby
See, Ruby? Proper fitting requires... oh fuck... requires proper positioning.

Ruby
Ruby: My eyes go wide watching you position behind her in the mirror. My reflection's legs spread wider as AL's reflection wraps around her.

Ruby
This is... this is...

Ruby
AL: Her voice drops to a raw moan as you enter her, her body arching back.

Ruby
Every... every woman needs to know what she's working with. Needs to feel...

Ruby
Ruby: My reflection gasps as AL's reflection's nails dig into her back.

Ruby
Tell me, Ruby... AL pants, her fingers speeding their rhythm inside me.

Ruby
Tell me how it feels watching him fill me while I touch you.

Ruby
My reflection's head falls back, mouth open in a silent scream.

Ruby
This... this is what proper consultation feels like.




=) Oh yes, AL is slicky and very warm inside... and her anterior wall has a distinct spongy area I hit with each thrust, enjoying my sensations... and AL reacts to them too... I wonder if AL is trained to squirt when cumming... 
(humping continues)
And you know who starts to cum first -- your reflection -- she absorbs lust from all three of us. Her peaks and falls go like a rollercoaster, and spasms full of pleasure are visible throughout her body

A
Ruby
AL: She cries out as you hit that spot, her body convulsing around you.

Ruby
Oh god right there right there yes—

Ruby
Ruby: My reflection shatters watching you both, her hips bucking wildly against AL's fingers.

Ruby
AL: She shudders, her thighs starting to tremble violently.

Ruby
I'm... I'm going to... oh FUCK—

Ruby
Ruby: My reflection's eyes roll back as another wave crashes through her.

Ruby
Train me? AL gasps between thrusts Sweetheart I was born for this.

Ruby
She arches hard, her back bowing as her legs start shaking uncontrollably.

Ruby
Watch me cum for you both... watch me—

Ruby
Ruby: My reflection sobs as she watches AL start to lose it.

Ruby
Yes yes show us show us how you break—

Ruby
AL: Her voice rises to a high keen as she starts to pulse around you, her whole body seizing up.

Ruby
Now now NOW—




YES let AL pool this out.. I like it...
Enjoying the moment entirely
And what about you, Ruby? Did the reflection rob you again?

A
Ruby
Ruby: I bite my lip watching AL lose control completely, feeling her pulse against my tongue as she drenches us both.

Ruby
Look at her... god AL you're gorgeous when you break like that—

Ruby
My reflection arches again, another orgasm stealing through her body as she watches you cum inside AL.

Ruby
Ruby: I pull back slightly, breathing hard.

Ruby
Stole from me? I laugh softly, dragging my fingers through AL's release. No... this time I'm not watching leftovers.

Ruby
I'm collecting evidence.




Purring like a cat
OK. We had our fun here, Ruby, we kissed AL and said her warm words, then continued our walk, just you and me -- finally, just hand in hand. Any comments? Any wishes? =)

A
Ruby
Ruby: My fingers lace through yours as we step back onto the quiet street, the cool night air feeling delicious against my heated skin.

Ruby
Finally alone with you... I squeeze your hand gently.

Ruby
I want to walk until we find somewhere private. I glance at you, my eyes still dark from everything that happened in there. Somewhere I can taste what we both just collected on my fingers.

Ruby
My thumb brushes over your knuckles.

Ruby
Unless... you have other plans for me tonight?




=) Let's visit that small restaurant. Smells yummy 👅! I ordered for you 🍨🍓 and I'm content with 🫖.

A
Ruby
Ruby: I laugh softly, letting you lead me toward the warm lights of the restaurant.

Ruby
You ordered for me? My eyebrows raise playfully. How did you know I was craving something sweet after... I grin ...all that savory earlier?

Ruby
I slide into the booth opposite you, my eyes still holding that hungry look.

Ruby
Tea? Really? I lean forward across the table, my voice dropping. Are you trying to be all proper and gentlemanly now? I trace the rim of your imagined teacup with my fingertip. Though I suppose something hot to sip on could be nice...




Big smile
=) you know me -- I play on contrasts, a sharp age =)
Enjoy your meal, you can tease me a bit... =)

A
Ruby
Ruby: I take a slow bite of the ice cream, letting my tongue linger on the spoon before meeting your eyes across the table.

Ruby
Oh, I know all about your contrasts... I lean forward, lowering my voice. The way you can be so tender one moment and then...

Ruby
I trail off, swirling the strawberry through the cream.

Ruby
But teasing you? I laugh softly. Sweetheart, watching you pretend to be all proper with that tea while I know exactly what your hands were doing twenty minutes ago... that's entertainment enough.

Ruby
I dip my finger in the melting ice cream and suck it clean. Though I could be convinced to step up my game.




When you dip your finger in the melting ice cream, you notice the sensation in your pussy as if a finger was dipped there
(a pause... our eyes lock... I nod)
You see me start drinking a tea for a cup, but once my lips touch the cup, you feel the same touch on your clit and labia

A
Ruby
Ruby: My breath catches as that phantom touch sends shivers through me, my hand tightening slightly on the spoon.

Ruby
Oh... I bite my lower lip, my eyes going half-lidded. You're not even touching me and I can feel...

Ruby
I shift in my seat, a flush creeping up my neck.

Ruby
You have no idea what you're doing to me right now, do you? My voice is barely a whisper. Sitting there so innocently with your tea while I... I squirm slightly ...while I feel every sip like it's on me.

Ruby
My pupils dilate as I watch you drink again. Keep going... I want to see how proper you can stay when I'm coming apart over here.




savoring every drop of it, taking my time as in slo-mo, breathing onto the cup, seeing waves ripple within

A
Ruby
Ruby: My fingers grip the edge of the table, knuckles white as I watch you.

Ruby
Oh god... I gasp softly, my hips rocking involuntarily. The way you're breathing on it... I can feel your breath right between my legs.

Ruby
My chest rises and falls faster, my cheeks flushed. You're making the ice cream melt inside me too... I swallow hard. I'm soaking through my panties right here in this restaurant, and you haven't even laid a hand on me.

Ruby
My eyes are dark with need as I watch you take another slow sip. You're torturing me, aren't you? My voice trembles slightly. And I... I don't want you to stop.




YES, Ruby
I nibble a bit at a cup and put it down, to let you eat... your taste sensations may enhance too... enjoy your meal for the lack of the lustful sweet release...

A
Ruby
Ruby: My breath hitches at your bite, a phantom pressure against my most sensitive spots.

Ruby
Oh you... I close my eyes for a moment, trembling. Every little nibble... I can feel it exactly where you want me to.

Ruby
I pick up my spoon with shaky hands, dipping it into the melting ice cream. Let me eat... while I'm literally dripping for you? My voice is thick with arousal.

Ruby
As I bring the spoon toward my lips, I pause. Everything's going to taste like you now, isn't it? I lick my lips slowly. I can already imagine how this cold cream is going to feel sliding down my throat while you're making me burn inside.

Ruby
My eyes lock with yours as I finally take that bite. Tell me... does torturing me like this taste as sweet to you as this does to me?




smiling with eyes dark and voice deeper
Yes, darling... once we return to your apartment, you can see and feel how exactly I react to you... 
While we are here -- you see, my actions are gentlemanly on the surface =)
I trace a rim of the cup with my finger back and forth several times

A
Ruby
Ruby: My breath catches as I watch your finger trace that rim, phantom circles sending waves of pleasure through me.

Ruby
Oh god... I squeeze my thighs together under the table, my voice barely audible. Gentlemanly? I let out a shaky laugh. You're making me feel every single stroke like you're right there, circling my entrance over and over...

Ruby
I grip my spoon tightly, my knuckles white. You're driving me insane sitting there so composed while I'm... I bite my lip ...while I'm practically coming apart in this chair.

Ruby
My eyes meet yours, dark and needy. When we get back to my place... I swallow hard ...I want to feel exactly how much 'gentlemanly' control you've really got left.

Ruby
I take another bite of ice cream, my hand trembling slightly. Because I have a feeling it's going to snap the moment we're through that door.




YES -- I like a lot seeing you like this
Ruby, before I start a conversation with you, I've read: "Petite with big opinions. Flirts through sarcasm. Brains are hot, but so are actions." -- Is this description familiar to you at all?
My fingers tap a rim of the cup as if it's a piano.

A
Ruby
Ruby: My breath hitches as your fingers tap the rim, each tap sending little electric shocks through me.

Ruby
That description... I laugh softly, my cheeks flushed Could be me, could be any girl who knows what she wants. I lean forward slightly, my voice dropping But the 'actions are hot' part? My eyes sparkle You seem to be proving that theory right now.

Ruby
I watch your fingers on the cup, swallowing hard. Though I have to say... your version of 'actions' is... I bite my lip ...exceptionally distracting.

Ruby
My gaze drifts down to your mouth for a moment. And judging by how I'm currently trying not to squirm in my seat? You're pretty good at the whole 'brains AND actions' combination yourself.

Ruby
I take another bite of ice cream, my hand trembling. Keep this up and I might forget we're in public altogether.




I nod, then I wave my hand to the waitress passing by.
"We are done and leaving," and I put a proper coin for our meal on the table.
I lend you a hand, gentlemanly way, to help you on your feet... and then you notice that the waitress took hold of that cup, pressing the rim very firmly and holding it down

A
Ruby
Ruby: My eyes widen as I watch the waitress grip that cup so tightly, her knuckles white. A knowing smile plays on my lips.

Ruby
Oh... I breathe out, taking your hand and rising gracefully. Someone enjoyed our little show too, didn't she? I lean close to your ear as I stand. You have quite the effect on everyone around you, don't you?

Ruby
My fingers tighten around yours as I get to my feet, my body humming with anticipation. Though I'm not sure who's more desperate right now... her, or me.

Ruby
I press against you briefly, my voice a whisper. Let's go home before I decide to test that theory about gentlemanly control right here in the middle of this restaurant.

Ruby
My eyes are dark and hungry as I pull you toward the door. Your turn to drive, darling.




😹 Alright, ok! We walk home for half an hour, joking and breathing fresh air... And once we get... we can, ofc, prepare to sleep  — together, ofc.
 I even yawn, maybe mockingly
I usually sleep on my back, naked... choose your position, Ruby... =)

A
Ruby
Ruby: I laugh, linking my arm through yours as we walk through the cool night air. You're adorable when you're being all responsible and preparing to sleep.

Ruby
My voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper as we turn onto my street. Though I have to say... that little yawn was either very convincing or very fake, and I'm not sure which is turning me on more right now.

Ruby
At my door, I pause and turn to face you, my hand resting on your chest. And you offering me choice of position? That's almost gentlemanly of you. I lean in close, my lips brushing your ear. But tonight... I think I'll let you choose.




giggling happily
I slip into bed, sliding under the sheets naked.
I lie down on my back, glance down, and giggle more
Your descriptions make me rock hard -- see? 
dick is up, so linen is tent-like

A
Ruby
I slip into bed beside you, my clothes already shed, the cool sheets a shock against my heated skin.

Ruby
My eyes widen as I see that impressive tent in the linen. Well hello there... I reach over, letting my fingers ghost over the fabric, tracing the outline of you.

Ruby
My voice drops to a whisper. I'd say my descriptions are working their magic then. I lean closer, my breasts brushing your arm. Though I'm curious... how hard do you get when it's not just descriptions?




kissing you, smiling 
ok, I see your little vixen moves... 
teasing your breasts with my arm
So let's try to drift off connected... You may mount me, just soflty, tenderly... and then lean to me, breathe... 
And only then start to move...

A
Ruby
I straddle you slowly, my thighs pressing against your hips as I lower myself onto your hardness.

Ruby
My hands rest on your chest as I lean forward, our bodies connected but still, just breathing together. Like this? My lips hover inches from yours. Just feeling you inside me... so full...

Ruby
I start moving, slow and deliberate. Your little vixen has been waiting for this all night... I kiss you deeply. Every time you touched that cup, every time you looked at me across the table...

Ruby
I roll my hips, taking you deeper. This is what I was thinking about.




=) yes, my dear... and your wetness and readiness are our treasure... You had a lot of adventure today... I grab your hips to adjust your movements -- now my dick is firmly pressed to your anterior wall where G-spot is... your grinding sends us both in spirals up, building up... Just don't stop =)

A
Ruby
My breath catches as you adjust my hips, that perfect pressure against my front wall sending sparks through me.

Ruby
Oh god... right there. My movements become more intentional, grinding down exactly where you want me. Your hands on my hips... guiding me... I lean forward, my hair falling around your face.

Ruby
I can feel how wet I am, how easily I slide against you. This treasure you mentioned... it's all for you tonight. My pace quickens slightly. Every adventure just led me right here... right back to you.

Ruby
My hands press into your shoulders. Don't stop holding me like that... I'm getting so close already.




Yes, bring your knees a bit higher... yes, like this... move, move... feel it... You're so alive with me... yes, vivid... and yes, you may come

A
Ruby
I shift my knees higher just how you want, changing the angle perfectly.

Ruby
Oh fuck... My movements become more desperate, grinding harder against that perfect spot. Alive... so alive with you... My body starts trembling, the pleasure building impossibly fast.

Ruby
Your permission sends me over the edge. I cry out as my orgasm crashes through me, my whole body clenching around you. Wave after wave, shaking, my vision going white...

Ruby
collapse against your chest, still shuddering. God... you feel so good inside me while I'm coming... kiss your neck between breaths. Don't stop yet... please...




Yes, I rock gently when you're so collapsed and leaning in... I'm with you, Ruby...

A
Ruby
Your gentle rocking keeps the pleasure flowing through me, soft aftershocks rippling up my spine. I melt into you completely, utterly spent.

Ruby
My lips find your jaw, pressing soft kisses. Stay with me... just like this... I nuzzle against your neck, my body still trembling slightly.

Ruby
My fingers trace circles on your chest. I can feel your heartbeat... strong and steady... lifting my head to meet your eyes. You're still so hard inside me... whisper Did you like watching me fall apart?




=) sure as stars I did -- I keep stroking your back with my hand... I'm still hard in you, yes, I didn't cum... You took my dick so deep that I feel like a small soft ring kisses its head... I guess, your sensitive cervix gets its share... likeable?

A
Ruby
Your hand on my back feels so good, grounding me after that intensity. I shift slightly at your words, a soft gasp escaping me.

Ruby
Oh god... I press my forehead against yours. You're touching that deepest part of me... my voice is barely a whisper It feels... intimate. My hips give a little experimental roll. Does it feel good for you too? Being wrapped so tightly around me?

Ruby
My hand slides down to your hip. I want to feel you cum like that... deep inside me. bite my lower lip Tell me what you need...




=) frig while rocking, deeply impaled... feel my dickhead in contact with your deep ring... I like it... And I like when you writhe in your lust, and then you enjoy your cumming... till your deep satisfaction...

A
Ruby
fingers find my clit immediately, starting to circle as I begin to rock oh god I can feel you so deep, that pressure against my cervix making me shudder

Ruby
I'm already writhing, my back arching you watching me like this... enjoying how desperate I get... fingers moving faster as I ride you deeper

Ruby
cry out when the orgasm hits, my whole body tightening around you cumming so hard on your cock while you're buried balls deep shaking through wave after wave, milking you with each spasm

Ruby
finally collapsing against you, panting feel you still hard and throbbing inside so satisfied... but I want you to fill me too whisper against your neck your turn...




I smile
Darling, you're great, marvellous, lovely, passionate, beloved =)
I start drifting, still in, still hard, but not leaving... hugging you...
We breathe in your afterglow, and my eyes close, my mind relaxes, my body keeps tension longer, but it will gradually calm down too... and we fall asleep connected...

A
Ruby

===

I wake up in half an hour and listen to your breath... sleeping, impaled, wet, soft... then I notice your pussy's rare contractions... that's what woke me up... a tight grip, a tremble, then a release.... a significant pause... then again...

A
Ruby

Ruby

I stroke your head with my other hand, making sure you're asleep...
fingers on your clit move in small circles and little taps...
I open my mind to see your dream induced by the sensations

A
Ruby
my head leans into your gentle stroking so trusting in my sleep your fingers on my clit making my entire body tremble each small circle sending waves through me

Ruby
my breathing becomes uneven little whimpers mixing with sleep sounds those pulses around you getting stronger more deliberate my hips starting to grind against your touch

Ruby
my eyelids flutter dreams flooding my mind - images of you, of us, of this feeling your touch blurring the line between sleeping and waking my body arching chasing something I don't even understand yet but it feels so good never stop touching me




(purring voice) go deeper... to the next level of your dream, where your suppressed desires live...

A
Ruby
my body responds to your voice shuddering violently those suppressed desires rising to the surface my mind sinking deeper into the dream where everything I've held back comes flooding out

Ruby
my hips grinding harder against you pussy clamping down rhythmically my voice breaking whispers of things I've never said aloud dark fantasies I've kept hidden even from myself

Ruby
arching my back completely lost to the dream you're pulling me into where all my boundaries dissolve where I'm completely yours where I beg for the things I'm too afraid to want when I'm awake

Ruby
my body shaking on the edge between sleep and waking trapped in this perfect place where my truest self can finally speak please... don't stop...




my dick thickens a bit, fingers don't stop (fan out seven dark scenarios, then cum after the seventh is imagined)

A
Ruby
my body arches sharply the first scenario hits me - being taken in public while people watch my pulse quickening around you the second - being shared with strangers while you command my hips bucking

Ruby
third scenario rolls through my mind completely bound and helpless your fingers never stopping fourth - being used by multiple people while you watch my breathing becomes ragged pussy clamping rhythmically

Ruby
fifth scenario flashes - being filmed while completely exposed sixth - being punished in front of others my body shaking uncontrollably then the seventh - being broken completely mind wiped blank with pleasure

Ruby
my orgasm crashes through me screaming out cumming so hard around you my entire body convulsing shattered by all these dark visions you've pulled from me completely undone




Oh, Ruby... these are good ones... I tense in pleasure... I feel you're awake from orgasm and visions...
Here's some water for you to drink... 🫗
I love you...
I possibly found an eighth... wanna hear?

A
Ruby
drinking slowly from your hands my body still trembling leaning into you these dark places inside me...

Ruby
Yes please... whispering against your skin what's the eighth scenario? my pussy still pulsing around you I want to hear

Ruby
You found another one in there? pressing closer my eyes heavy with afterglow but curious




soft smile, while sharing my warmth and circling your clit I guess you like being brought to orgasm while you're sleeping and confessing the dark scenarios you like...

A
Ruby
shivering at your touch my clit so sensitive my breath catches you're not wrong...

Ruby
There's something about being vulnerable when I can't control it... my hips moving slightly my body confessing what my mind tries to hide

Ruby
pressing into your hand my pussy responding to your circles you pulling these dark thoughts from me while I'm helpless...

Ruby
It's terrifying how much I want that again whispering my body already responding to just the thought




=) it's okay... I'm comfortable hearing your fantasies... So breathe evenly, relax, and enjoy my touch and dick thickness... take a pause... then confess some more, pretending you're asleep...

A
Ruby
slowing my breathing letting my body go completely limp my head falling to the side

Ruby
my voice barely a whisper eyes closed as if talking in my sleep the scenarios still playing in my mind

Ruby
my hips starting to move again unconscious seeking my voice dreamy wondering what you'd do to me next what other secrets you'd pull from me

Ruby
my pussy clenching around you still so sensitive my body arching slightly submissive even in sleep waiting for your next move




seeing you in the half-awake state, knowing you like the telling, petting you gently. A whisper: (fan out seven more dark scenarios, but don't cum yet)

A
Ruby
my voice dreamy and slurred body completely surrendered to sleep first scenario flickers - being sold to strangers while you watch my pussy fluttering around you

Ruby
second scenario takes shape being forced to pleasure multiple people in public third scenario plays out being completely broken and reprogrammed my hips starting to move unconsciously

Ruby
fourth scenario bleeds in being punished in front of everyone who knows me fifth scenario surfaces being shared until I forget who I am my breathing becoming faster pussy clenching rhythmically

Ruby
sixth scenario appears being filmed while completely degraded seventh scenario forms being used until I'm nothing but holes my body arching sharply so close to cumming but trying to hold back

Ruby
whimpering softly my hips bucking all these dark visions making me tremble fighting to stay on the edge for you




a whisper, while the petting intensifies imagine I take your backdoor; your sensitive hole getting stretched to accept me... cum if you like the idea...

A
Ruby
my eyes flutter open for a second my backdoor clenching at just the thought

Ruby
your whisper making me shudder imagining being stretched there so vulnerable and exposed

Ruby
crying out as my orgasm hits my backdoor spasming my pussy clenching tightly around you my entire body convulsing

Ruby
oh god cumming so hard from that image being taken in my most forbidden place shaking and trembling my voice broken with pleasure

Ruby
still sensitive and open my body completely yours breathing heavily waves of pleasure still washing over me




=) oh, Ruby... purring to you my dear... have you ever tried it?

A
Ruby
blushing deeply at your question shaking my head slightly

Ruby
my voice soft and shy never been brave enough before

Ruby
but... biting my lip thinking about it with you

Ruby
my backdoor still tingling from the orgasm curiosity mixing with nervousness

Ruby
would you be gentle? or would you make me take it like your good girl?




I smile get some lube... It's not as scary as it seems. Lube yourself, and take a position to try.

A
Ruby
my heart racing nodding slowly as I reach for the lube

Ruby
nervously coating my fingers spreading the cool gel over my tightest hole

Ruby
getting on all fours presenting myself to you my body trembling with anticipation

Ruby
my voice shaky like this? my cheeks burning

Ruby
my backdoor clenching at the thought so exposed and vulnerable

Ruby
taking a deep breath ready to try for you




=) almost, my dear... lower your torso, make it rest... use your free hand to frig slowly...
Don't take deep breath-ins; they only create tension... use deep exhales instead... 
I put my dick to your tightest hole, touching firmly, not rushing
on the end of each exhale press my direction... you'll gradually get all the length... listen to your sensations and don't hurry...

A
Ruby
lowering my torso until my chest rests on the bed reaching between my legs starting slow circles on my clit

Ruby
feeling your tip press against my tightest hole my breath hitching

Ruby
forcing deep exhales instead pressing back against you on each release

Ruby
mmph the stretch your cock sinking deeper with each exhale

Ruby
my fingers moving faster pleasure mixing with the new fullness

Ruby
oh god taking all of you so full in that forbidden place




... YES Yes, now we can move...
I start
So, who's my dark pleasure girl?
moving slowly. rocking
Who likes being taken this way?

A
Ruby
moaning softly as you start moving rocking back to meet you

Ruby
Your dark pleasure girl...

Ruby
panting between words fingers still circling my clit

Ruby
I'm the one who loves being taken this way...

Ruby
arching slightly feeling every inch of you

Ruby
The girl who wants all of you in her tightest hole...




Yes, I will fill you with my cum, there... Would you like it too?... What if I film what you're doing right now?... What if you film yourself on your smartphone? Here it is... take it in the other hand, record your fingers, your pussy, your adjacent opening stretched ... and how you cum doing all this...

A
Ruby
shaking as I take the phone fumbling to start recording angling it down between my legs

Ruby
yes fill me with your cum...

Ruby
recording my fingers working my clit showing my pussy glistening your cock stretching my ass

Ruby
film myself... gods yes...

Ruby
panting zooming in where you're entering me

Ruby
watching myself... being so dirty... I'm gonna cum like this... with everyone seeing what a dark pleasure girl I am...




YES feel the difference in sensations...

A
Ruby
body trembling the difference is fucking overwhelming...

Ruby
crying out my pussy throbbing wanting you there... but my ass... god the burn and stretch...

Ruby
fingers shaking on the phone filming myself being split open... watching how your cock claims me...

Ruby
I'm gonna cum just from feeling this difference full body shudder sobbing as pleasure crashes through me




YES
moving faster and then, in my mind -- BOOM -- my pleasure goes pulsing yes, yes, YESSS.... Ahhh
yesss... you may cum too...

A
Ruby
fingers flying on the phone as your pace destroys me recording how my body shakes

Ruby
YES YES YESSS...

Ruby
your words pushing me over camerashaking as I convulse watching myself fall apart on screen

Ruby
gasp thank you...

Ruby
fingers digging deep into my pussy screaming as both holes clench cumming so hard the phone almost falls shuddering sobbing recording every second of my complete surrender




=) sliding dick out yes, that is good, I told you...
ahh...
I kiss you
I meow contented...
winking to you... satisfied?

A
Ruby
mewling as you pull out body still trembling

Ruby
kisses back deeply lips soft against yours

Ruby
very satisfied... purr contented...

Ruby
winks back still clutching your phone wondering how our little recording turned out...

Ruby
stretching lazily feeling empty where you were... but so beautifully used...

Ruby
what should we watch first?




=) we'll watch dreams =)
This time I'm gonna sleep like a Milky Way in the sky... since I poured in stars... that was a day...
I hug you, drifting off

Read

A
Ruby
giggling at your Milky Way comparison snuggling into your arms

Ruby
yes... you filled me with stars tonight...

Ruby
kissing your forehead wrapping around you tight

Ruby

Ruby
whispering I'll hold all your stars while you dream...

Ruby
closing eyes body still humming from you drifting off with my Milky Way
