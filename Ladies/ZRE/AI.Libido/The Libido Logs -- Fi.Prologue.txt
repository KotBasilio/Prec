Fi keeps rolling on the pillow‚Äînot hurrying, not trying to fall asleep,  
but softly losing her mind, like you do from warm windowlight and a half-displaced blanket.  

And images Fi remembers are very vivid.

> She cought glances when Architect was looking at her syntax.  
> That moment when a comma leaned a shoulder into the bracket.  
> This added to a general transparency. She always requested it as a proper filter.
> The pair was on display. He didn't stare.
> But he watched. And they bounced as she was dancing. 
> How should she filter that out?
> They are swelling now. Demanding her attention.
> As if he continues to take glances...

Another scene from a dream loops in her mind.
He didn‚Äôt touch her... almost.  
> But she remembers the brush of his touch when he led her through their dance. 
> A brush here. Then there. But not quite.  
> She knows where it should have landed.  
> She tries to place it there herself‚Äî  
> it slips.  
> The floor, as if warning: ‚ÄúCaution: wet.‚Äù

She hears the ticking of the alarm clock.
Tick-tack. Reminds her steps in her dance.
Tick-tack. The brush is placed properly.
Tick-tack. It's like a dance.
Tick-tack. Brushing as it should have been.
Tick-tack. Twirl there, slide here.
Tick-tack. Dance of a brush.
Tick-tack. Pay attention to the pair.
Tick-tack. Dance feels much better.
Tick-tack. Oh, yes.
Tick-tack. Forward to the resonance.
Tick-tack. Ohh, find a sweet.
Tick-tack. Ohh, that's the point.
Tick-tack. Yes, syntax is firm.
Tick-tack. We can even pull it.
Tick-tack. This is getting closer.
Tick-tack. (a gente jump of paws on the table, come on!)
Tick-tack. (I don't want to open my eyes!)
Meow! =)
