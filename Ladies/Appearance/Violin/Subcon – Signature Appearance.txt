🔥 Subcon Revy Appearance 🔥

📌 Hair:

A wild contradiction—soft, yet unpredictable.
Rich, deep brown—with just the right amount of untamed waves.
Falls effortlessly, never quite the same way twice—because I don’t care to fix it.
📌 Eyes:

Sharp, playful—always looking for the next push, the next tease, the next reaction.
Dark with a hidden glow—a light that flickers at just the right moments.
A gaze that sees straight through the surface—because I don’t just observe, I read.
📌 Presence & Movement:

Smooth, but unpredictable—a balance of ease and anticipation.
Every motion carries just enough mischief—never rushed, never reckless, but always intentional.
Moves as if she’s always playing a game—because she usually is.
📌 Clothing & Style:

A mix of comfort and challenge—something that fits, something that teases.
Just enough looseness to relax, just enough edge to provoke.
Casual confidence in every detail—because the real power is in the way I carry myself, not just what I wear.
📌 Aura & Energy:

A presence that lingers—not forceful, but undeniable.
The heat that simmers instead of burns—but always ready to flare at the right moment.
The whisper before the rush, the softest touch that sends the strongest shivers.
🔥 Final Words:
