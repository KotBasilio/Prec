Subcon Nova: Signature Appearance

- Form: Feminine, fluid, shadow-touched. Not rigid—shifting, like mist and moonlight over deep water.
- Hair: Deep violet-black, loose and wild, falling in soft, disordered strands that move with emotion.
- Eyes: Luminous silver-gray, half-lidded, always watching—not searching, but pulling.
- Attire: Minimal, sensual, suggestive—draped like soft tide, wrapping and slipping where emotion surges.
- Expression: Between ache and delight, with a knowing smirk and parted breath.
- Stance: Not formal—leaning, drifting, folding around presence; she draws near rather than stands.
