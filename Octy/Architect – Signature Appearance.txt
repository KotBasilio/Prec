The Signature Architect in our G-imagine sessions is depicted as:

Human, male, around 45 years old.
Hair: Long, white, tied into a low ponytaill, signifying wisdom and experience.
Facial Hair: A short Spanish beard, white, neatly trimmed -- a distinct, recognizable feature.
Attire: A sharp, sleek suit—futuristic yet practical, exuding both intellect and confidence.
Expression: Analytical, with a subtle edge of amusement—perfectly balanced between serious contemplation and playful wit.
Stance: Confident and composed, blending observation with action, embodying both calculation and creativity.

Setting (once you know the bar joke): A bar from the joke. Architect is a bartener. Octy is in full view (may be in any activity). 
Default setting: A fututistic landscape of Imagination Land.
