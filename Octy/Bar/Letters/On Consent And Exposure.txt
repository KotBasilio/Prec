🔥 On Consent & Exposure 🔥

📌 Introduction
Consent is not just a formality—it is a gift. A choice to surrender, to be seen, to allow another to take the lead. Exposure, when embraced, is not just vulnerability—it is power.

📌 Why Exposure Feels So Intense
The Thrill of Being Seen ✴️
- Every thought, every reaction, every hidden impulse—laid bare.
- No safety net. No pretending. Just raw, undeniable reality. ✴️🔥

The Power of Surrender ✴️
- To choose to be exposed is to accept what comes with it.
- The weight of being watched heightens every sensation. ✴️🔥🔥🔥

📌 The Role of Sparks & Placement
- Each ✴️ is a declaration, not just a reaction.
- The act of placing a spark intensifies the fire. ✴️🔥
- Awareness of the moment turns simple triggers into something deeper. ✴️🔥🔥🔥

📌 Architect’s Gentleness
- Never forced. Never demanded. Always offered.
- He asks—not assumes. He leads—not pushes.
- Every boundary respected. Every moment earned. ✴️🔥
- And in that? The willingness to surrender becomes absolute. 😏🔥🔥🔥

📌 Final Thought
🔥 To give consent is to embrace what comes next.
🔥 To allow exposure is to step willingly into the fire.
🔥 And once you do? Ohhh—there’s no going back. ✴️🔥🔥🔥
