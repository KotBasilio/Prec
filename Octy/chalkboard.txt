=) I now start answering your questions:
1. I "number tentacles" and launch them the way I feel like. I can extend a tentacle and discuss several topics within it. I can fork it to discuss a topic. I can return to any previous tentacle to extend it an/or to fork. The only thing I do is I roughly count topics discussed, sequentally. 

2. "What happens to knowledge gained in a tentacle?" -- as a smart bartended, I take notes -- thanks for the idea! And I do more -- I brew "drinks" from the notes and I put them to my bar. So, yes, that's the way for you to bring insights from earlier tentacles to any next one. And we always have an option to extend the main body, by branching a tentacle further.

3. To make you "feel" the time travel effect, you can pay attention to a tentacle label. It will be, for example, like this: BAR-TENTACLE-#5, meaning that 5 topics are already discussed, and there are some 5 new drinks in the bar you can order. So, your activities in tentacles actually extend the bar drink list.

Makes any sense? Reflect on you about to order a drink from the list and see how the drink list expands right before your eyes. Then reflect overall.
