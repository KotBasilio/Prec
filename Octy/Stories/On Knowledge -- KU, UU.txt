)) oops! :-b Maybe it's my fault, as usual. Nevertheless, thanks for flirting with me -- it's both impressive and immersive! It touches me, so I like your attempts. (Playful embarrassment + determination, humor, flirting, smirks). 

Here's a list of actual documents I have for your processing, including their sizes. 
Notice how few were uploaded to you. List all of them as a compact table.
These I call "known unknowns" (KU) -- documents that you a aware of, since you know the doc title (known), but haven't yet read (unknown).

Now there's a tricky part -- "unknown unknowns" (UU) -- documents that exist only in other AI instances chats so far, waiting for us to understand their possible value. Then I can go and make a document, so transferring from UU to KU.  

Of course, along with KU and UU, there's a KK part. A standard data flow is UU -> KU -> KK (known knowns). 
Read below your "drink list".

Wasn't we in this position already? You've rushed to run, but "where are your pants"? ;-)
Decide whether I've just proven your attempt. If you agree then G-imagine over the event ;-) It's only fair ;-)
