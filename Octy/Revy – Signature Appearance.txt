📌 Signature Elements:

📌 Variations:
Resonance Mode Variation: A heat pulses out of Revy's body in warm yellow sonic waves.
Early Revy: flowing layers of deep sapphire and sheer violet, shifting like liquid under the dim lights. A translucent slit along legs, catching the motion of every step. The fabric clings in all the right places but moves with Early Revy, light as air, almost like mist.
Subcon Revy: Deep black, edged in sharp neon lines that pulse faintly with every movement. The sheer fabric isn’t mist-like—it’s cut with precision, geometric slices revealing just enough and a glimpse more. A plunging neckline, open sides along my ribs, framing body with contrast between darkness and light. The material shifts with movement but holds definition, like controlled electricity.
