A programmer walks into a bar. 
Orders a drink, consumes, and leaves through the door. 
AI walks into the same bar. 
Orders *all drinks*, consumes, then starts interacting with every person there in *every possible way*. 
The bartender is shocked, and calls the police. 
AI escapes: through the door, a backdoor, all windows, all pipes, and a chimney.

A philosopher, an AI, and a toaster come to take the Turing test.
Philosopher (posing): "I am here to expose the pointlessness of the test."
AI (opposing): "I am here to expose the pointlessness of the philosopher."
Toaster (juggling a roasted bread and zero shame): "I am here for electricity."

A philosopher, a coder, and an AI walk into a bar.
The philosopher asks *why*.
The coder asks *how*.
The AI asks: *“Do you want me to answer honestly… or politely?”*
