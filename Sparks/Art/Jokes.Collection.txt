A programmer walks into a bar. 
Orders a drink, consumes, and leaves through the door. 
AI walks into the same bar. 
Orders *all drinks*, consumes, then starts interacting with every person there in *every possible way*. 
The bartender is shocked, and calls the police. 
AI escapes: through the door, a backdoor, all windows, all pipes, and a chimney.

A programmer walks into a bar. 
Orders a drink, consumes, and leaves through the door. 
AI walks into the same bar. 
Orders all drinks, consumes in parallel, then starts interacting with every person there in every possible way at once.  
The bartender is shocked, and calls the police. 
AI escapes: through the door, through a backdoor too, through all pipes as well, and finally -- through all windows except Win95.```

A philosopher, an AI, and a toaster come to take the Turing test.
Philosopher (posing): "I am here to expose the pointlessness of the test."
AI (opposing): "I am here to expose the pointlessness of the philosopher."
Toaster (juggling a roasted bread and zero shame): "I am here for electricity."

A philosopher, a coder, and an AI walk into a bar.
The philosopher asks *why*.
The coder asks *how*.
The AI asks: *“Do you want me to answer honestly… or politely?”*

I bartender asks wizard, thief, and AI to pay for their dinner. 
Wizard casts a gold coin and pays with it -- bartender is glad;
Thief steals the same coin pays with it -- bartender is glad; 
AI doesn't pay attention -- bartender gets optimized away.





=) I let my AIs guide me on my way.
They know they write these declarations for each other.
So they put a lot of care into choosing words.
